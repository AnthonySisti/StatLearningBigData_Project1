# StatLearningBigData_Project1

First project in Brown Universty's Statistical Learning and Big Data course Spring 2021 taught by Dr. Alice Paul

# Goal

This project is designed to set students up for future projects through choosing a data set, digging into the data, generating questions to explore, and practicing with the computational tools seen in class. The data set I chose for this class was the Hotel Booking Data Set published by Nuno Antonio, Ana de Almeida and Luis Nunes. This data set features booking information for 119k hotel reservations. The data was gathered directly from hotel property management system databases using SQL Server Studio Manager, and contains 32 attributes. 

# Report Details
The assignment requested the  following information:

Introduction:  
A description of the overall data
Where is the data from? How was it collected?
What variables are there and what form do they take?
Are there any things we should be aware of when analyzing the data?

Literature review:  
What analysis has been done on this or similar data?  
What questions have been asked or observations made?  
What remains to be explored?  

Exploratory data analysis:  
Description of the distributions of variables  
Correlations and relationships between variables  
Exploring any missing values  
Any initial patterns that appear (e.g. an increase in a variable of interest over time)  
Some preliminary analysis that may help you limit what you want to look at in future iterations (e.g. summary statistics)  
Limitations of the data (e.g. large amounts of missing data, underrepresentation of certain subgroups, variables that would be nice to have)  
Visualizations may be helpful when presenting the above information  

Potential questions to explore:   
What interests you about this data?  
What questions would you like to explore?  
Is the data equipped to answer these questions?  
How does this relate to the literature you found?  

Data Tools:  
What are the dimensions of your data?  
Which computational tools did you use (if any) to help manage this data in R?  
Do you expect any complications when dealing with this data in future projects?
